Hello. My name is Toli. I'm lover of experimentation, dogs, and travel. And I am a Javascript Developer with Aspergers and Bipolar Dispolar. I am passionate about creating simple, intuitive interfaces and promoting mental health education.

I work full time at HOVER Inc. But I am available for small consulting projects (coding, social media marketing, and business development).
